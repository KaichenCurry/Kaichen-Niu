PREDICTING CREDIT CARD FRAUD USING MACHINE LEARNING
Introduction

According to a report by security.org (2023), 65% of people with credit or debit cards have experienced credit card fraud at least once. Fraud can occur in various forms, such as skimming, identity theft, phishing, and online transactions. The growth of online shopping and new payment methods, like auto-pay and contactless transactions, has led to increased credit card use, often making it more convenient than cash. By applying machine learning techniques, we can analyze data on fraudulent transactions and gain valuable insights to address this issue.

Key Objectives & Significance of the Research

Analyze and preprocess real-world transaction data.
Use machine learning methods to identify and classify fraudulent transactions.
Assess algorithm performance through metrics like accuracy.
Identify the strengths and limitations of different models for fraud detection.
This research focuses on identifying characteristics of fraudulent transactions and building predictive models to detect them.

Goal

The primary goal of our project is to apply machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and categorize fraudulent transactions within credit or debit card data. By implementing models such as Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, we evaluated each modelâ€™s performance in terms of accuracy. Among them, the Decision Tree model was the most effective, achieving a 96.75% accuracy rate, with Logistic Regression following at 93.53%. Through these insights, our project aims to contribute to the development of robust fraud detection systems, thereby improving security and trust in financial transactions.
